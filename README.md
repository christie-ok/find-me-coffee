# FindMeCoffee

"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco" is a quote attributed to Mark Twain. It's actually uncertain if he ever said that, but the sentiment remains - May, June, and July tend to me gray, foggy, and chilly in San Francisco. 

So as summer approaches, this is a little script to help you keep warm until Bay Area summer actually starts (probably early September).

Download this script and run it from your command line to get a list of all the food trucks in San Francisco who are serving nice hot coffee!

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```
> git clone https://github.com/christie-ok/find-me-coffee.git
```

Go to the script folder:
```
> cd find-me-coffee
```

Grab necessary dependancies:
```
> mix deps.get
```

Run the script:
```
> mix find_me_coffee
```

Choose a spot that looks good and enjoy!
